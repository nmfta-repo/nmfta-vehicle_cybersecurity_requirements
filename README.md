# NMFTA Heavy Duty Vehicle Cybersecurity Requirements (HDVCR)

Cybersecurity requirements for heavy duty vehicles developed in collaboration with motor freight carriers, OEMs and cybersecurity experts.

The cybersecurity requirements captured here are for use by fleets to include in their procurement process with OEMs. The requirements are intended to cover the following truck body configurations, which we intend to cover most of what LTL carriers need:
* North America "on highway" Class 7-8 trucks e.g. the classic truck w/ trailer or double as the  most common configuration
* and also the last mile delivery truck with a dry freight truck body that could include a lift gate


## How to Use the HD VCR

We recommend that fleets use these requirements by following some steps during the procurement process. We are open to feedback on how to improve the requirements and the process.

1. Fleets should ask OEMs to identify all the modules in the requested truck by the *Device Classes* below.
2. Fleets should prepare questionnaires to be completed by the OEMs based on the classes found.
3. OEMs complete the questionnaires, answering in the affirmative if all devices of the given class satisfy the requirement. Deviations and rationale can be noted in the provided cells of the questionnaires.


## Device Classes

The VCRWG analyzed several truck vehicle network architectures and performed a risk analysis to classify the known truck electronic components into a series of device classes. The cybersecurity requirements for procurement are assigned to these classes. Each device identified, its assigned class and the rationale for assigning that class are captured here in a truck order sheet view for ease of use by the fleets.

# Cybersecurity Requirements

This is still a work in progress. The WG expects the cybersecurity requirements to be similar to the Telematics Security Requirements Matrix https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-telematics_security_requirements but will incorporate more requirements pertaining specifically to vehicle components. The WG started with a small subset of the requirements to prove methods and tools in the https://github.com/nmfta-repo/vcr-experiment.

# Other Resources and History

The previous work on cybersecurity requirements by the NMFTA CTSRP (then, HVCS) was to create the Telematics Security Requirements Matrix https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-telematics_security_requirements . These requirements were ported to this project and re-applied where possible. The questionnaires for those requirements and also contract template language was captured in the https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-rfp_templates repo.

The initial work to create these requirements started with a vehicle network architecture survey in collaboration with OEMs. The results were:
* a picture of 'typical' Class 7-8 truck networks, circa 2021 -- can be found in the "degrees of separation" captured in the [`resources/Component_Class_Assignment_v17_DRAFT.xlsx`](resources/Component_Class_Assignment_v17_DRAFT.xlsx)
* a list of common components/modules/devices names and aliases -- mapped to the J1939 names wherever possible -- can be found in the "reference names" captured in the [`resources/Component_Class_Assignment_v17_DRAFT.xlsx`](resources/Component_Class_Assignment_v17_DRAFT.xlsx)
* a risk analysis of components/modules/devices in those networks as it pertains to fleets (aka fleet risk)
* the assignment of the components/modules/devices to *Device Classes* as captured above -- can be found in the "proposed device class" captured in the [`resources/Component_Class_Assignment_v17_DRAFT.xlsx`](resources/Component_Class_Assignment_v17_DRAFT.xlsx)

Some preliminary work on capturing security (and functional) requirements for vehicle gateways performed during the Nov 2021 CTSRP meeting was done in the https://github.com/nmfta-repo/vcr-experiment where the [`strictdoc`](https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc) requirements format was assessed. A gap analysis of the Canis labs CAN security gateway against those requirements was performed in April 2022 and the analysis is available freely [here](https://kentindell.github.io/assets/docs/2201%202022-03-22%2036507b1b09a6dd9cdbc07c4e0686c4b16ed8a1a0d317726ccc9e3cc3060a4e39.pdf).

The test plan used by the CTSRP for onsite vehicle testing is provided as a starting point for an eventual acceptance test plan for these requirements; available here: [`resources/heavy vehicle testing plan.md`](resources/heavy_vehicle_testing_plan.md)
